Chair Side Solutions,SQ7721357,Chair Side Solutions,SQ7721357,NK Optik Otoflash G171-6 Curing Unit with Nitrogen Port,"Flash-curing device for rapid and reliable curing of light-curable resins. The Otoflash is a light polymerization chamber for the hardening/curing of light curing resins for jewelry, dental, and otoplastic applications. Two photoflash lamps at the bottom of the curing chamber operate in a work mode with a frequency of 10 flashes per second. The photo-flash lamps produce a very intensive light radiation in a spectrum from 300 up to 700 nm. Because of this intensive light radiation, a better hardening of the materials is possible, resulting in materials with good physical values and reduced content of residual monomer versus using other lamp types with a different light emitting spectrum. The G171 Otoflash includes protective gas appliance (N2). This prevents any oxygen inhibition on the surfaces so that they're cured completely non-stick without any need to remove or wipe away the inhibition layer.

Chair Side Solutions,SQ6708300,Chair Side Solutions,SQ6708300,Aidite Biomic Stain & Glaze Aesthetic Kit - Aesthetic Kit,"All in one A Stain/Glaze suitable for all types of ceramic restorations, like zirconia, glass ceramic, porcelain, etc., Universal coloration system for all restorations. Simple to use The coloration pastes of the Biomic Stain/Glaze are simple and user friendly. With the recommended schematics from Aidite, technicians can utilize the simple system to achieve ideal aesthetic results. Bionic aesthetics The composition of 2D paste color in Biomic Stain/Glaze completely mimics the colors of natural teeth, the 3D paste combination then creates the aesthetic effects. At the same time, 3D pastes can be used to adjust the tooth surface morphology, and slight contour distinctions. Processing Tips Low-temperature powder can be mixed into Glaze-F to form a special paste. If it is too thick, it can be mixed with coloring liquid 1. If you want to make a special color 3D paste, just mix the powder with 3D Natural, and add the coloring liquid 2 to adjust the consistency as needed for easy operation. All the surfaces of all-ceramic crowns can be adjusted with 3D paste. The 3D pastes contain porcelain powder, which will increase the thickness after sintering, and can be used to increase the occlusal contact area, abutment surface and incisal length. When micro-cutting the full crown, 3D paste can be directly used after dyeing to achieve the same effect as porcelain.

All the surfaces of all-ceramic crowns can be adjusted with 3D paste. The 3D pastes contain porcelain powder, which will increase the thickness after sintering, and can be used toincrease the occlusal contact area, abutment surface and incisal length. When micro-cutting the full crown, 3D paste can be directly used after dyeing to achieve the same effect as porcelain. To reduce the surface brightness of the restoration after sintering, the sintering temperature can be reduced to 715 ℃. To improve the surface brightness of the restoration after sintering, the sintering temperature can be increased to 750 ℃. You can increase or decrease the surface brightness of the restoration by manual polishing after glazing. Under normal operation, white zirconia does not need to use pink coloring liquid for internal dyeing treatment, and can be directly dyed with the gum suit. If you need strong chroma, you can use Pink R or Pink 5 to cover the surface of the framework first.

All the surfaces of all-ceramic crowns can be adjusted with 3D paste. The 3D pastes contain porcelain powder, which will increase the thickness after sintering, and can be used toincrease the occlusal contact area, abutment surface and incisal length. When micro-cutting the full crown, 3D paste can be directly used after dyeing to achieve the same effect as porcelain. To reduce the surface brightness of the restoration after sintering, the sintering temperature can be reduced to 715 ℃. To improve the surface brightness of the restoration after sintering, the sintering temperature can be increased to 750 ℃. You can increase or decrease the surface brightness of the restoration by manual polishing after glazing. Under normal operation, white zirconia does not need to use pink coloring liquid for internal dyeing treatment, and can be directly dyed with the gum suit. If you need strong chroma, you can use Pink R or Pink 5 to cover the surface of the framework first.

Chair Side Solutions,SQ8437500,Chair Side Solutions,SQ8437500,Photodontist VPR 500 Smartphone Rig,"Vu’s Phone Rig diffuses two LED panels to your smartphone to create powerful yet soft lighting for your dental photography. Designed by Dr. Vu Le and 3d printed in his garage workshop, it’s the only patented product on the market that uses a magnetic quick release–no more clamps or screws. VPR has the highest light output of any dental product on the market…it’s bright enough to act as a fill light across a room. The VPR is protected under under U.S. Pat. No. 10,667,696 B1 Update: New stock is expected 5/25/2022 All VPR units have these awesome features: Compatibility with all major smartphones: iPhone 13 Pro Max, Samsung Galaxy S2x Ultra Plus, Note 20 series. Anything under 100mm wide for VPR 500 Magnet quick mount – attach the included steel stickers to your phone case, and two huge embedded magnets secure your phone to the VPR. No clamps, sprints, or adjustment wheels are required. Diffused dual lighting – Offset diffuser panels are securely mounted to the frame create soft yet defined lighting. The diffusers also reduce eye strain for your patients (shaded eye goggles are still recommended for them). In body charging – LED panels can be charged without removing them from the frame using standard micro USB cables (included) and any USB charger (not included). Hot swap capability – you can purchase spare LED panels for hot swapping during long shoots. Designed and made by a dentist, for dentists and their team members. Tripod mount Customer support – we personally answer emails, phones and texts. 1 year warranty – we will replace defective parts with free shipping within the USA (international customers may incur additional shipping charges) 30 day return policy – return the product with no questions or strings attached. Advatanges of newer VPR 500 over the older VPR 400: Larger light source = softer light at equal distances 2.8x more light* at maximum intensity than the VPR 400*1.5 stops of exposure difference spot metered at 150 and 300mm from subject 50 percent more battery capacity (3000 mAh vs 2000 mAh per LED panel) OLED digital display – you know exactly how much light every time higher maximum power – useful at longer distances bi-color LED’s – warm or cool the color temp of your light. Warm light to blend with your room light for testimonials, blue light to make your work pop. We are the ONLY dental photography solution with variable color temperature. larger camera opening which allows use of camera without zooming (though at least 3x zooming is still recommended for intraoral shots) Wider “sweet” spot – all shots look good, but there is a wider “sweet spot” of distances where it looks the best. So it’s more forgiving of shooting too far away. Future proof – No phone has broken the 80mm width limit of the human thumb. But VPR 500 could accomodate a theoretical 100mm wide phone. Parts availability – the VPR 500 is built on a newer LED panel from a larger company, so it’s more likely (though not guaranteed) to be available for replacement parts longer Reasons to pick the unigrip: Unigrip is my personal favorite. It’s the smallest, lightest, and easiest to travel with. It’s held in your right hand, similar to an SLR. Your thumb presses the screen button to take a picture. Doctors who shoot during surgeries tend to favor the unigrip. You can brace the left side with your other hand for added stability when needed. The unigrip is the sturdiest model Reasons to pick the dual grip: Dual grip adds a tactile bluetooth button (optional to use) It’s much more stable for video shooting. You can still use your thumb to press the screen button if you prefer. Assistants and hygienists tend to favor the dual grip model. You can still hold it in one hand if you need your other hand to retract. The two removable feet allow it to stand over other objects on the countertop. Here are the setup instructions for the VPR 500. Pricing: The basic unigrip is $599.99 MSRP and is a great fit for most users. All VPR 500 variations produce the exact same lighting and image quality. Additional grip options will add comfort for some, but will slightly increase size, weight and cost. New variations now available! Bluetooth dual grip models! These are the new “forte” design, which are fused into the body for an ultra stable, ultra strong unit. Bluetooth dual grip adds an additional $70 to the unigrip, as its significantly more intensive to build. New colors available! (more colors and photos coming soon) Color prints require 3-5 more business days of production time. The custom printer setup adds $50 to the cost.
